The "Design Document" design document

The goal of a game area design document is to provide a cohesive direction for developers that want to add or modify content in the game. New PRs should aim to align themselves with the design as laid out in the document, and Maintainers are expected to adhere to them when reviewing and discussing PRs.

These documents are meant to be "directional" documents rather than "implementation" documents; focus should be on defining the goals and boundaries of a game area, not the specific game mechanics the player interacts with. The documents should include high-level descriptions of gameplay and the intended *feeling* players should have when interacting with the game area. 

Below is the recommended template to use:

# Document Name

## Abstract
A short blurb that condenses down the information of the document. Sets the expectations for what the document will contain and helps ease into the other sections' more list-like format.

## Intended Experience
Short descriptions of what a player should expect when playing/interacting with this game area. This is "the pledge"; what the game promises it should feel like. The game does not have to live up to the pledge all the time, but should try its best to capture it.

## Responsibilities
What the game area is responsible for in terms of station duties and gameplay/mechanics. If the game area is a resource provider to the station, this is highlighted here.

## Desired Gameplay
The kind of gameplay and mechanics we want to see in the game area's design. Should be a short one-sentence description followed by a more detailed explanation. 

## Undesired Gameplay
Easy pitfalls and directions we *don't* want the game area to move in. This sets boundaries and helps achieve cohesion when designing new aspects of an area.

## Roles
Where applicable, include the relevant in-game roles for this design document.
