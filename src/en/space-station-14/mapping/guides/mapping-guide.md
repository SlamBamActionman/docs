# Mapping Guidelines

This document intends to give you helpful tips and guidance on how to create a fun and playable Space Station 14 map! 

These guidelines are only for the design of the station. For instructions on how to map and commands to use, please read the the [General Guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/space-station-14/mapping/guides/general-guide.html).

Remember! These are ultimately guidelines and not rules; you may choose to disregard them, but you should be able to explain *why* you are doing so.

## Starting Out

### Planning The Layout

There are multiple ways to begin mapping, but to save yourself the trouble of constantly remaking and replacing items over and over, it's recommended you start with planning out the layout of rooms, walls and passageways first. This can be either done in the mapping tool itself, or by using external tools such as a pixel editor to more easily move designs around. Even a simple pencil sketch can be of great help.

Use existing stations as inspiration and guidance! Comparing at the size of departments and general areas can help with determining how many players your station will be able to support and inform how many lockers, ammenities and what power structures need to be mapped.

### Station Theme

When trying to conceptualize a new station, it can be useful to decide on a **theme**, **lore** or **gimmick** for your map as a starting point. This can help inform decisions you make about the station's layout and design, to ensure that it feels cohesive and unique. The default setting of SS14 stations is a corporate research station accommodating NanoTrasen workers and passengers. Some examples include:

- Oasis: Has a **theme** around a greenery, with a **gimmick** of a large central room in the middle of the station. 
- Fland: Has a **lore** of being built as part of an asteroid, with a **theme** of indoors asteroid rocks as part of the station.
- Core: Has a **gimmick** of the Singularity being in the center of the station, with a **theme** of dirt and rust.
- Plasma: Has a **gimmick** of active plasma pools on the station, with the **lore** being that the station is an old plasma asteroid mining rig, with the **theme** being dusty asteroid hallways.

Remember! Having a theme or focusing on a gimmick does not guarantee a good station! Seek feedback, playtest early and don't half-ass your concept.

## General Station Layout

When designing a station, you want to have a healthy balance of **Departmental**, **General** and **Maintenance** areas. 

Avoid dead end hallways and areas.
